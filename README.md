Turns a raspberry pi into a secure and anonymous torrent box with just one command.  ART will setup your pi to use a vpn for all traffic ensuring your anonymity.  It will also monitor your IP address to ensure the vpn is working correctly at all times.

**Current Status:** In Development nearing Alpha

# Compatible VPNs:
ART will automatically configure openvpn to use the following popular vpn services:

  * [Torguard](https://torguard.net/)

# Setup

  1. Get your raspberry pi setup and running a stock image of debian wheezy.
  2. Download this script using wget.

      `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssmereka/art/master/art.sh`
      
  3. Give the script permissions to run and run it.

      `sudo chmod +x art.sh && ./art.sh -s`
